## List of data-related risks in ACS:

- CMIP6 downloading into oi10:
  - NCI governed
  - Communication/planning issue?
  - Download requests not being filled in a timely manner, or correctly (missing data), and a lack of updates about such requests.
  - Regular downloads of high-demand variables were shut off? This caused issues for GCM-ensemble analysis as newer data were not automatically replicated.

- 3 month delays on NCI project quota changes:
  - NCI governed
  - Communication issues?

- BARPA has no data engineers to perform CMORisation:
  - ACS governed
  - Allocation/workforce issue

- Not enough storage in xv83/ia39:
  - ACS governed
  - Data-planning issue / practicality limitations

- Resolutions of some RCMs do not align with CORDEX DRS
  - ACS governed
  - Not sure where origin lies.
  - BARPA is 17km, CCAM-Qld is 10km, neither of which as CORDEX Domain?

- Scratch purging on NCI
  - NCI governed
  - Modification time instead of access time? 
  - Known issues due to purging?

- RDP incomplete for ACS (Research Data Planner)
  - CSIRO governed
  - Only impacts CSIRO-lead projects but scope for RDP is difficult
  - Some efforts have been made, is it a problem that it is only preliminary?
