When it comes to external hosting services for your git repository, there are a number of choices...

### CSIRO Bitbucket
https://bitbucket.csiro.au

- The code in a public repo can be viewed (and downloaded) by anyone, but only CSIRO account holders (or external collaborators that have had their accounts created via the [PUMA system](https://my.csiro.au/Tasks/IT-and-computing/Accessing_CSIROs_Network/PUMA)) can view, submit or respond to pull requests and Jira issues
- The regular issue tracking functionality that comes with repos hosted at [bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org) (i.e. as opposed to Jira issues) isn't available on the CSIRO instance
- Free to CSIRO account holders
- Code is hosted on CSIRO servers

### NCI GitLab
https://git.nci.org.au

- Everything (i.e. code, issues, pull requests) in a public repo can be viewed (and downloaded) by anyone, but only NCI account holders can interact with the repo (i.e. submit or respond to issues and pull requests)
- You can also have a private (specified maintainers only) or internal (NCI account holders only) repo
- With the community version of GitLab that NCI is running you can create individual repos/projects but not GitLab Groups
- Free to NCI account holders
- Code is hosted on NCI servers

### GitHub
https://github.com/

- Everything (i.e. code, issues, pull requests) in a public repo can be viewed, downloaded and interacted with (although it is possible to [temporarily restrict interaction](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-repository) with the repo)
- Free unless youâ€™re doing pretty hardcore stuff (https://github.com/pricing)
- Code is hosted on servers in the US
