# Data and Code Review

Before a collection of files (e.g. data files, images) is shared widely,
they must be reviewed by the Data and Code Group to ensure compliance
with our data ([`data_standards.md`](data_standards.md))
and code ([`code_roadmap.md`](code_roadmap.md)) standards.

## Data review criteria

For authoritative datasets:

1. TODO

For processed files:

1. TODO


## Code review criteria

For processed files:

1. Has the code, along with details of the software environment and data processing steps,
   been archived in an online repository that can be accessed by
   the users of the files (e.g. a repository in the ACS GitHub organisation)?

2. Would someone familiar with the programming language/s used
   be able to re-run the analysis?
   
3. Would someone unfamiliar with the programming language/s used
   be able to broadly understand how the analysis was conducted?
   
4. Should the code be published in the ACS Zenodo collection,
   or is a tagged GitHub release sufficient?
