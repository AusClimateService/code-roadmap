# Data and Code Group

A “Data and Code Group” has been established within Work Package 4
to develop and implement data and code standards across ACS Project 2
and to coordinate the associated infrastructure, support and reporting to management.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/AusClimateService/data-code-group/wiki) for meeting minutes etc.
