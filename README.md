# Data and Code Group

A “Data and Code Group” has been established within Work Package 4
to develop and implement data and code standards across ACS Project 2
and to coordinate the associated infrastructure, support and reporting to management.

### Communication

The group meets once a month via Microsoft Teams (see `minutes/` and `agenda.md`) and
chats on that platform between meetings
(reach out to damien.irving@csiro.au if you'd like access to the chat and/or invites to meetings).
Action items are managed via [tagged issues](https://github.com/AusClimateService/data-code-group/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22action+item%22).

### Documentation

Major documents are hosted within this directory:
- `data_roadmap.md`: How we plan to manage/store ACS data
- `data_standards.md`: Plans for dataset/file metadata standards
- `code_roadmap.md`: How we plan to manage ACS code
- `review.md`: How we plan to review ACS data and code to make sure it meets our standards

Additional notes on various topics are hosted in `notes/` or
as [tagged issues](https://github.com/AusClimateService/data-code-group/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Anotes).

### Active members
