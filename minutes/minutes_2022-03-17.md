## Data and Code Group meeting, 17 March 2022

### Attendees

Damien Irving, Chloe Mackallah, Mitch Black, Marcus Thatcher, Naomi Berger, Dougie Squire, Claire Trenham, Ben Schroeter, Fran√ßois Delage

### Notes

- Chloe is working on defining a [hierarchy of data products](https://github.com/AusClimateService/AusClimateService/blob/main/data_hierarchy.md).
Feedback welcome.
- Ben is working on a package for validating/applying metadata templates to data files: see [axiom](https://github.com/AusClimateService/axiom)
- Chloe has applied for a new NCI reference data collection ("ACS Public Data - CORDEX")
- In the long run it is hoped a new ACS Microsoft Teams instance can be used to store shared documents.
In the meantime, some people are using GovTeams and others a [GitHub documentation repo](https://github.com/AusClimateService/AusClimateService).
- It's been difficult to collect enough information to get a clear picture of storage and compute needs across ACS work units.
It was suggested that a better approach might be to maintain a risk register
where work units can flag storage and compute issues that they're worried about.
- Progress is being made on the [Australian Community Reference Climate Data Collection @ NCI](https://github.com/aus-ref-clim-data-nci).
Small, widely used datasets are being added first and then decisions will be made about larger datasets (e.g. reanalysis).
- Tom Remenyi has reached out about linking ACS with the [Federated Climate Data Initiative](https://www.eratos.com/journal/federated-climate-data-initiative-newsletter-1).
At this stage there's nothing the Code and Data Group needs to decide/do.
- It was decided that these meetings should happen once a month with chat in Microsoft Teams in between.

### Actions

- [ ] *Damien* to reach out to ACS researchers about a possible ACS shapefile repository.
- [ ] *Damien* to reach out to the maintainer of the AgData Hub collection of BoM data (with commercial license) for CSIRO users to find out exactly what version the dataset is.
We can then determine whether BoM and CSIRO people are using the same data.
- [ ] Create a storage/compute risk register for ACS work units to fill out / update
- [ ] *Chloe* to upload (to this repo) a flow diagram describing the hierarchy of data products / data processing workflow
